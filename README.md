+ Create a working website based off of a prototype made in figma with desktop and mobile responsiveness
+ Peer reviewed by: Overall I would say the design look like the figma and works well. However I noticed some small mistakes for example on the garden page the nav bar resets and the links are all blue and to the left. Another one is that on mobile the message box is below where it is supposed to be. Lastly the links for the mobile nav bar dont work. - Zahid Afsar
