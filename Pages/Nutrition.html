              Foodie and obsessed label reader that I am, I’ve tried many
              products and recipes in an attempt to improve the health of myself
              and my family. Nothing makes you question food like when you put
              it on your child’s plate. Occasionally I find great products I
              want to share with everyone I love. This page is dedicated to
              those products and in some cases I am partnered with the company
              in an affiliate relationship. When that is the case I of course am
              blessed with compensation should you choose to purchase from the
              link. Like I said, I only share the products I feel are worth it
              and I align myself with company’s researched by myself. Links are
              attached. Thanks for your support. It means the world to me. XO

              This is the one product that I have fed to my family for the last
              8 years consistently. It has been and continues to be thoroughly
              researched and recommended by professionals in the health and
              wellness field for decades. Their home base is in Tennessee but
              shared globally. This company, “delivers concentrated plant-based
              nutrition that helps you bridge the gap between what you should
              eat, and what you do eat, every day”.

              These beautiful towers are space age looking but allow anyone in a
              small or large space to grow their own food. Brought to you by the
              same company as the nutritional support system. Did I mention
              their mission is to “Inspire Healthy Living”? I find that just
              amazing!
